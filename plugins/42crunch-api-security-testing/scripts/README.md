# Bundled scripts

Deterministic helpers the skills invoke instead of inlining code in the
reference docs. Each reads 42c-ast output (or an OAS file) and prints a compact
TOON summary; the script body never enters the model's context, only its
output does. All are pure Python 3 standard library (no pip installs) except
where noted.

## Invocation path

Copilot exposes no plugin-root environment variable, so scripts are addressed
through the `<scripts>` placeholder — the absolute path to this `scripts/`
directory, resolved once during pre-flight (see `references/pre-flight.md`) and
substituted literally into every invocation. They therefore resolve regardless
of the user's working directory (commands run from the project git root, not
the plugin):

```bash
python3 "<scripts>/<name>.py" <args>
```

The script bodies are identical across all ports; only this addressing note
differs between hosts (other hosts substitute their own plugin-root variable).

## Scripts

| Script | Reads | Prints |
|--------|-------|--------|
| `oas_preview.py <oas>` | an OpenAPI file | title/version, auth schemes, per-operation id-refs (BOLA signals), BFLA markers, sample-data flags — the scan preview, without loading the OAS into context |
| `extract_audit.py [DIR] [--locations IDS]` | `DIR/todo.json` + `sqg.json` (default `/tmp/42c-audit`) | scores, per-issue-type TOON rows, SQG verdict, before/after score delta (via `DIR/.baseline.json`); `--locations` resolves issue occurrences to OAS paths |
| `extract_scan_happy.py [STATUS] [REPORT]` | happy-path run status + report | failing happy-path tests, or `happy_path_failures: none` |
| `extract_scan_summary.py [STATUS] [REPORT]` | full-scan status + report | sqgPass, blocking rules, request/issue totals, deduplicated failure list |
| `compare_auth_bodies.py [REPORT]` | full-scan report | owner-vs-attacker body comparison for each defective BOLA/BFLA finding (Step 12a-0 confirmation) |
| `scanconf_bootstrap.py alias <oas>` | an OpenAPI file | the derived 42Crunch alias (reads only `info.title`) |
| `scanconf_bootstrap.py set-host <conf> <url>` | a scanconf | writes the `host` variable object in place |
| `scanconf_lint.py <conf> [--graphql] [--fix-required]` | a scanconf | structural findings (ERROR/WARN), exit 1 on any ERROR; `--fix-required` flips generated `required:true` vars to `false`; `--graphql` adds the Accept-header-narrowing check |

## Judgment stays with the model

These scripts surface **facts and mechanical transforms only**. Candidacy
decisions (which id-ref is a real BOLA target), classification (A–D), fix
generation, and every consent gate remain the model's job — `oas_preview.py`
deliberately over-surfaces BOLA/BFLA signals (recall over precision) for the
model to filter and confirm with the user. `scanconf_lint.py` checks only
mechanical structure (inline requests, `defaultResponse`/`responses` mismatch,
variable shape, `skipped:true`, Accept-header narrowing); scan *design* —
creator placement, BOLA/BFLA wiring, classification — is not its concern.

## Dependencies / limitations

- **YAML OpenAPI files**: `oas_preview.py` and `scanconf_bootstrap.py alias`
  need PyYAML for YAML specs. When it is absent they exit 2 with a clear message
  and the caller falls back to reading the OAS directly. JSON specs (including
  every generated scanconf — so `scanconf_lint.py` and `set-host` never need
  PyYAML) need nothing beyond the standard library.
- **Windows without python3**: the reference docs point to
  `references/windows-commands.md` for a PowerShell fallback when python3 is not
  on PATH; otherwise these scripts run identically under Windows python3.
